**LDR (LoadDecrunchRun or LoaDeR)**

- LDR is the successor of Decrunch.js
- ~~After visualizing decrunching process i also want to show the loading process~~
- Decrunching doesn't take long but loading does. Visualize loading first
- Do it as an esm module
- Still offer zip functionality using UZIP, if wanted
- Visualize loading progress if possible
- multiple parallel loads possible

## Thanks goes to
- Copperbars for colorful life
- Greggman for ESM version of UZIP
- Photopea for UZIP
